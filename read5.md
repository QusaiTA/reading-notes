# Loop's ..
*Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.*

*in another word's : You can think of a loop as a computerized version of the game where you tell someone to take X steps in one direction, then Y steps in another.*

**Example :**

> for (let step = 0; step < 5; step++) {
  // Runs 5 times, with values of step 0 through 4.
  console.log('Walking east one step');
}

*There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times and i mention the most two important of them ..*

1. **For Loop :**
*A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.*


  *A for statement looks **as follows :** *

> for ([initialExpression]; [conditionExpression]; [incrementExpression])
  statement

  2. **While statement :**
  *A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows :*

 > while (condition)

   >statement

   **Example :**

   > let n = 0;

  > let x = 0;

 > while (n < 3) {

 > n++;

 > x += n;
}
