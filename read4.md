# Learning About JS Control Flow.. 

*The **control flow :** is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.*

Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

 that also mean : when you read a script, you must not only read from start to finish but also look at program structure and how it affects order of execution.
