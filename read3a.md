# How to create your first WIREFRAME

**Wireframe** mean : *
Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product.*

**Keep in your mind the following :**

1. *Wireframes drawn with paper and a pencil, or at a whiteboard, have the advantage of looking and being very easy to change.*

2. *With the help of paper-prototypes, you can test with end users at every stage of ideation and design.*

3. *Switching later to software (after initially hand-drawing your wireframe) allows you to keep track of more detailed decisions.*

**Best Tool for Making Wireframe :**

1. **UXPin :** *UXPin has a wide range of functionalities, but one of the best ones is how it facilitates building responsive clickable prototypes directly in your browser.*

2. **InVision :** *InVision allows you to get feedback straight from your team and users through clickable mock-ups of your site design. It’s completely free too!*

**Let's go and learn HTML !**

*What **HTML** mean ?*

**HTML :** *HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.*


**Anatomy of an HTML element :**

*The main parts of our element are as follows:*


**The opening tag :** *This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.*

**The closing tag :** *This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.*

**The content :** *This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.*

**The element :** *The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.*


**Nesting elements :**

*You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized.*

**example of nesting elements :** 
> My cat is <strong>very</strong> grumpy.
> My cat is <strong>very grumpy.</p>.

**Empty elements :** 

*Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <img> element that we already have in our HTML page.*

**example of Empty elements :**

> img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image">

**Semantic :**

*In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code — for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)*

**Semantic in HTML :** *In HTML, for example, the <h1> element is a semantic element, which gives the text it wraps around the role (or meaning) of "a top level heading on your page."*

**Example :**

>This is a top level heading</h1>

**Some of the benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:**

* Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO).

* Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.

* Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless divs with or without semantic or namespaced classes.

* Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.

* Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.
