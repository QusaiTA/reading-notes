# Growth Mindset

**The term “growth mindset” comes from the groundbreaking work of Carol Dweck.
She identified everyone holds ideas about their own potential.
Some people believe that their intelligence is more or less fixed and in math – that you can do math or you can’t.
About 40% of students have these damaging “fixed mindset” ideas. Another 40% have a “growth mindset” – they believe that they can learn anything and that their intelligence can grow. The other 20% waver between the two mindsets.**


### reminder of growth set :
- > *Accept opportunities that push you out of your comfort zone.*
- > *You don't know what you don't know.*
- > *Appreciate obstacles.*
