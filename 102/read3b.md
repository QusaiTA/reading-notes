**What is CSS ?**

*(Links to an external site.)
CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.*

**CSS** *stands for Cascading Style Sheets*

**There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:**

1. **External CSS:** *With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section..*



2. **Internal CSS:** *An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
The internal style is defined inside the style element, inside the head section.*
 


3. **Inline CSS:** *An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.*



**Benefits of CSS: **


*CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.*

*CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.*
