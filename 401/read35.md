## [Graphs](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html)
**Graphs**
  * Graph - a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
    - Vertex - also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
    - Edge -  a connection between two nodes.
    - Neighbor - neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
  * Undirected Graph - is a graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional, and this means that the undirected graph does not move in any direction.
  * Directed Graph - also called a Digraph is a graph where every edge is directed. Each node is directed at another node with a specific requirement of what node should be referenced next.
  * Complete graph - is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
  * Connected graph - is graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge. A Tree is a form of a connected graph.
  * Disconnected graph - is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
  * Acyclic graph - is a directed graph without cycles. Cycle is when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself.
  * Cyclic graph - is a graph that has cycles. Cycle is defined as a path of a positive length that starts and ends at the same vertex.
  * Adjacency matrix - is represented through a 2-dimensional array. If there are n vertices, then we are looking at an n x n Boolean matrix
  * Sparse graph - is when there are very few connections
  * Dense graph - is when there are many connections
  * Adjacency list is the most common way to represent graphs, and is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected. Also, make it easy to view if one vertices connects to another.
  * Weighted graph - is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.
  * Traversals - required to traverse through a graph. The traversals itself are like those of trees. 
  * Breadth first traversal start at a specific vertex/node. This node must be specified when calling the BreadthFirst() method.
    - Enqueue the declared start node into the Queue.
    - Create a loop that will run while the node still has nodes present.
    - Dequeue the first node from the queue. 
    - If the Dequeue‘d node has unvisited child nodes, add the unvisited children to visited set and insert them into the queue.
  * Depth first traversal, we approach it a bit different than the way we do when working with a depth first traversal of a tree. Similar to how the breadth-first uses a queue, we are going to use a Stack for our depth-first traversal.
  * Real World Uses of Graphs
    - GPS and Mapping
    - Driving Directions
    - Social Networks
    - Airline Traffic
    - Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
