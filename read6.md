# Functions .. :

*Meaning of **Functions :**  is similar to a procedureâ€”a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it. *

*A **function definition :** (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:*

* *The name of the function.*

* *A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.*

* *The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, {...}.*

**Look At Example Below :**

>function square(number) {

>  return number * number;

> }
